The quiz asks the player set of 5 questions and everytime the player gets the answer incorrect, the timer deducts the time by 15 seconds. And if the player gets the answer correct, the timer goes up by 20 seconds. The questions are multiple choice questions and the player clicks the answer he/she thinks is correct. The player when done with the quiz gets to enetr their name and the score is displayed with the players name. While displaying the score, the player gets to select the option of playing the gane again or clear the score.
